# This is an unfinished(Dead) project with useful instruments
# Instruments implemented: Dialogue System with useful creation tool, Atlas System with independent saving, Settings, Controls, Menu, Saving System with O/C principle.
# OOP standarts are met, but code not commented.


1. Dialogue system has its own creation tool(A bit slow in performance, probably) and includes branching, some override possibilities and a lot of code to read, tbh.
2. Atlas is a tool to create some descriptions for characters, worlds and other things that you want, types included, ofcourse, so, open for extension.
Also atlas has independent from main save saving system for collectioning.


Another code is just interesting for research, but it is project dependent mainly, still can be used in another places, mainly you can use Dialogue and Atlas Systems, they are pretty easy and functional.
